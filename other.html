        <p class="org-description">The Bachelor of Science in Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering program is designed to produce graduates who possess knowledge, skills, and attitudes in the application of engineering science and designs to the processes and systems involved in the sustainable production, post-production, and processing of safe food, feed, fiber, timber, and other agricultural and biological materials; the efficient utilization of, conservation, and management of natural and renewable resources; and development of climate change mitigation measures to enhance human health in harmony with the environment. Agricultural and Biosystems (AB) consist of crops, poultry, livestock, fisheries and aquaculture resources, forestry and other plants, new and renewable energy, wastes, natural resources, and climate.
            <br>
            The graduates of BSABE are expected to understand and apply engineering science and designs to identify, analyze, and create solutions for problems concerning land development; irrigation, and drainage including dams, farm roads and bridges; AB production machinery; new and renewable energy; AB buildings and structures; postharvest and processing technologies; climate change, and natural resources, environmental and waste management.</p>
